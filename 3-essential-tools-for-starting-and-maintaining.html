But what is an adequate supply of capital?   The only way to tell is by doing a significant amount of research on your potential market and formally documenting this in a business plan. I’m sure you know that a business plan is a very important document that is crucial to convincing your banker to lend you money.  <br><br><br>There are two ways to obtain a business plan. <br><br><br>1) Do it yourself by amending a business plan template, or <br>2) Hire a professional to do it for you. <br><br><br>Obviously obtain 1) will be a great deal cheaper.  <br><br><br>Our research led to a website that has over  60 high quality and free business plan templates.  We also found a directory that you can use to easily find a business plan writer in your city – where ever you live in the world. <br><br><br>Finding Customers<br><br><br>Finding customers is a difficult and expensive task for service business owners such as accountants, lawyers and plumbers.  We believe that a cost effective marketing strategy for service business owners is to simply give all their personal contacts a few business cards.   <br><br><br>Our research led to a few websites that have pre-designed business card templates. We felt that the diversity and quality of these designs was outstanding. In addition, we found that you can obtain a significant saving by finding a printing service on the Internet. We found that you could get 2,000 full color business cards for as little as US $150. <br><br><br>Accounting For, Budgeting and Controlling Revenue and Expenses<br><br><br>Accurate accounting is very important for small business owners. It’s essential that you have timely access to information that could make or break your business. If stocks are running low – you need to know about it. If a large proportion of your debtors haven’t paid – you need to know about it. If you do not react to these situations quickly you may have a situation where you don’t have enough money to pay your employees – or worse still someone is stealing cash out the till.<br><br><br>Our research led to a website that compares and reviews  top accounting software for small businesses.  The cheapest software cost US $89.99 and the most expensive software cost US $1,499. It was interesting to note that the top 3 ranked websites were not the most expensive and cost between US $250 - US $300.<br> <br><br>Hopefully you now have an idea of some of the tools that you can use to grow and maintain your small business.
