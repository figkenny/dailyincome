      They Include?</b></font><br>
      &nbsp;by: <font color="#FF6600"><b class="author">Kevin Erickson</b> </font>
      <p>Ok... so you've finally reached that stage in the development of your 
      home business to get started. You've done the research, you have a game 
      plan and you're ready to go except for one small detail... you need money. 
      Whether it comes from a loan or from investors it doesn't matter but you 
      need a good dose of seed money to put all your hard work and planning into 
      action. However, regardless of who hears your money pitch before they give 
      you a dime they will want see your business plan. </p>
      <p>Business Plan - What Is It? </p>
      <p>A good way to think of a business plan is that's it's a document that 
      provide answers to the type of questions anyone who may provide financing 
      would like to know about your home business. You will not get outside 
      funding without one, because the people giving you the funding will insist 
      on one because it helps them to know that you’ve thought through what 
      you’re proposing to do. A business plan says to them... &quot;I’ve considered 
      this from every angle, and here’s what I’ve come up with&quot;. </p>
      <p>Business Plan - What Does It Include? </p>
      <p>What is your product or service? This is the first question every 
      business plan should answer. You must explain in the clear, concise 
      language what in the world you plan to produce or what service you plan to 
      provide. You will also want to include why you've chosen this particular 
      product or service. </p>
      <p>Who are Your Customers? After you've explained your product or service, 
      the next step is to identify who you plan to sell your product or service 
      too and why. The demographics (age, sex, language, country, state or city, 
      income, etc.) You need to clearly identify your customers in order to 
      properly target your advertising, packaging, pricing, et. </p>
      <p>What Makes You Different? You need to identify the &quot;primary factors&quot; 
      that will make your business different than other businesses you'll be 
      competing with. What niche are you filling that they are not or what do 
      you plan to do to fill a particular void in the market that you've 
      identified? </p>
      <p>What are Your Expenses? Your start-up expenses include any equipment 
      that you need before you can get up-and-running, while your day-to-day 
      expenses are staff costs and supplies. </p>
      <p>Following is a Simplified Example of Business Plan </p>
      <p>This a a simplified and shortened version of a business plan. In the 
      real world... each one of the following sections would be 1 - 2 pages in 
      length. That being said... in most instances it's better to be as brief as 
      possible. Only add information if your potential backers request it. It's 
      a bad idea to go into too much detail in your plan. You’re not trying to 
      explain everything down to the nth detail, just the basics of the business 
      and why they should give you the money you need to launch it. And always 
      focus on profit. </p>
      <p>Catering Plus </p>
      <p>Nature of Business: The business will be a home-based catering company, 
      producing luxury food for special occasions such as birthdays and 
      weddings. We will provide a comprehensive catering service, while 
      specializing in high end customized cakes, which have a higher profit 
      margin than other foods. </p>
      <p>Target Market: Our catering business will be aimed at middle-class 
      customers who desire a top-of-the-line catering but must operate on a 
      budget. Our initial market area will consist of Mytown and the affluent 
      area of Theretown. </p>
      <p>Key Factors: We will only use commerical grade ingredients purchased 
      from wholesalers and provide top quality design and service. This will 
      allow us to provide food that looks tastes great, while keeping costs as 
      low as possible. </p>
      <p>Expenses: Beause I will be using my kitchen and making the food myself, 
      there are only two real expenses: The purchase of an industrial grade 
      mixer and then the day-to-day cost of supplies. I've attached a suppliers’ 
      letter listing prices. Our research has shown that this supplier offers 
      the best value for start-ups. </p>
      <p>To wrap it up, you should include a breakdown of both projected profit 
      and loss per month (in graph form)for the first year in business. Show 
      one-time and day-to-day expenses versus projected profit to indicate how 
      you will pay-off your loan. Your business plan should show you making 
      enough of a profit each month to live on – if it doesn’t, then it may be 
      considered unfeasible. </p>
      <p>Study a Few Real-World Business Plans </p>
      <p>The best way to get a real a feel for the dos and do nots of a business 
      plans is to find real-world plans that have already been approved and 
      study them. A good place to start is the internet. Once you’ve studied a 
      few, you will get a better feel for how much work will be involved in 
      putting your business plan together. Remember, until your business exists 
      for real, the business plan is the only tool you have to sell prospective 
      backers on how great your business is going to be</td>
