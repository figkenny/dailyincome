              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">An unpleasant aspect of modern life is the fact that thieves can steal files from computers.  Personal emails, business plans, private documents, trade secrets, and online histories can all be devastating if they fall into the wrong hands.  It is a good idea for people or businesses to have a type of file shredding software that keeps thieves and hackers from being able to obtain this type of information.  File shredders are available for all major computer platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Apple, and Linux.  File shredders are usually very reasonably priced; most cost under $30, and some are even free.    <br><br>Many people mistakenly think that computer files can be easily deleted from the computer’s hard drive.  They believe that a file is permanently gone once it is put in the trash or recycling bin and the bin is emptied, but the truth is that the files are still on the computer; they are just slightly more difficult to access.  Recovery software is available that can bring back previously deleted files.  People must use special software to permanently remove files for the computer’s hard drive.    <br><br>There are many reasons to use file shredders.  They can erase confidential information so that others will not be able to view it.  File shredders can delete the entire hard drive, including all files, folders, and previously deleted material.  File shredders can also delete emails and all history of online activity.  <br><br>People may need to regularly delete sensitive material from their computers.  Doctors, lawyers, and psychologists need to be especially careful about maintaining their clients’ confidentiality.  Businesspeople need to keep certain trade secrets and business plans secret from their competitors.  Also, any financial records, credit card numbers, and bank account information should be protected as well.  File shredders can be easily used to permanently delete all of this material.  With most file shredders, all it takes is a simple drag and click to permanently remove files.<br><br>It is a good idea to erase the entire hard drive of a computer before disposing of it.  If another person obtains the computer, they can access anything that the previous owner had on it if the hard drive is not erased.  Financial records, credit card numbers, personal information, and histories of website visits will all be out in the open for the new owner to view.  File shredders can prevent this from happening.    <br><br>File shredders are valuable for all computer users.  Anyone who ever purchased anything over the Internet, written a personal letter to someone, or stored confidential business information on their computer would be well advised to use a file shredder.
