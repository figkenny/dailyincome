              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2"><br><br>Did you know that satisfaction is the number one emotion<br>people want to experience about their life and business?<br>Yes, fame and fortune are up there, but satisfaction is<br>the key. Satisfaction is about contentment, gratitude and<br>pure joy. Are you satisfied with your business and your<br>life? If not, read on and see how you can transform your<br>life in the simplest method possible.<br><br>To be satisfied is to enjoy each step along the way, to<br>be able to integrate the practical with the fanciful, to<br>continually refine your dream or vision.<br><br>You need a vision for your business. You had it at least<br>once in your life, especially if you chose to go into<br>business for yourself. You may be making the money<br>that you want, have fame in your community, but still<br>are unhappy and wonder - "Is that all there is?"<br><br>If you are in any way unhappy or dissatisfied with your<br>life or your business, you need to re-ignite your original<br>vision or create a new one. But wait, you say, you already<br>have a business plan. Isn't that sufficient for your<br>business success?<br><br>Why Isn't a Business Plan Enough?<br><br>A business plan is for banks and credit institutions, but<br>outcomes are based more on desire than on business<br>plans. Vision with a Capital VÅ is bigger than a business<br>plan. The difference is, if your vision is not articulated,<br>you cannot include it in your business plan.<br><br>Who Besides Me Benefits from My Business Vision?<br><br>Customers know when you have a clear, passionate<br>business vision. The benefits clients, customers and<br>vendors receive are a result of your clarity about the<br>dream of your business. The more you can relate your<br>vision to your family and community, the more you can<br>excite everyone. More excitement attracts the customer<br>of your dreams.<br><br>Lance Armstrong wanted to win the Tour de France. Once<br>he achieved this goal, his vision was to win more Tour de<br>France's than anyone. He did just that; he created a World<br>Record of six wins. What he also did benefited the country<br>of France, even though he is an American. France's<br>tourist dollars increased. American television advertising<br>grew as more people tuned into these races. Armstrong's<br>battle with cancer increased donations to the American<br>Cancer Society. Benefits abounded for anyone connected<br>to bicycle riding, including manufacturers and sports<br>clothing providers.<br><br>Do Independent Professionals and Micro Businesses Need<br>a Vision Too?<br><br>Definitely! Independent professionals and micro businesses<br>require the clarity of a vision. Martha Stewart started<br>small. She was a caterer after she completed her career<br>as a model. A product of her times, the 1950's, Martha's<br>first thought was to make a home look warm and inviting.<br>As a great cook, Martha created elegant, well-designed<br>meals and events. She had her vision for success.<br><br>When Martha Stewart dreamed well into the future, she<br>had a vision of a conglomerate business, with far-reaching<br>rewards. She created OmniMedia, with her own magazine,<br>television shows and products; all sold worldwide. From<br>small business visions, big business visions grow. Even in<br>prison, Martha continued to expand her Vision with a Capitol<br>V to include two new television reality shows. Martha<br>never stops expanding her Vision with a Capital VÅ.<br><br>You now have the key to your business future, the joy that<br>can make your efforts worthwhile. You will also achieve<br>fame and fortune as an outcome, but satisfaction is the<br>key. Be satisfied with yourself. Create a Vision that helps<br>move you forward.<br><br>Enjoy yourself, your business and your life.<br>
