              <td align="left"><span class="style2">BLOGS! What a crazy name for the "NEWEST" Internet<br>marketing trend to hit the Internet.<br><br>But, I like it.<br><br>It makes this new form of communication kind of mysterious<br>in a way, though, BLOGS have been around for quite some<br>time and only recently have been recognized as a VERY<br>valuable asset to Internet marketers.<br><br>Recently, I was visiting some Internet marketing related<br>Forums and noticed many of the threads having similar<br>"Subjects" saying... "What the heck are BLOGS?"<br><br>So, I did a little research and this is what I came up with<br>since I was Very curious myself.<br><br>I think it's best that I clearly define to You exactly what<br>a "BLOG" is so that as I go through this article with you,<br>you'll have a clear picture in your head of what a Blog IS<br>and so there won't be any confusion.<br><br>A "BLOG"(A.K.A. Web Log) by definition is:<br><br>A combination of online diary and/or guestbook. You sign up<br>for a blogger account and then you enter the information<br>You want on your Website. Then you can set it so that only<br>you can place entries on it or so that anyone can. Then you<br>can either keep a private journal or you can have a place<br>where your readers can get together and place entries to<br>each other or to you.<br><br>So... there you have it in a nut shell.<br><br>To simplify it even more let's just say BLOGS are a place<br>to go and post your personal thoughts that you can share<br>with your subscribers and/or readership and receive<br>feedback.<br><br>Now, for the purpose of this article, now that you know the<br>true definition of a "Blog", I'm going to share with you<br>some reasons WHY they're becoming a widely recognized<br>"POWER TOOL" for Internet marketers around the world.<br><br>So, with that said, lets go to Reason #1.<br><br>Reason #1. Great way to stay in touch with your subscribers.<br><br>Blogs are a great way to stay in touch with your<br>subscribers and/or readership and builds regular readership<br>Traffic to your little community where you can interact<br>with them.<br><br>It also helps build rapport, which in turn, will help<br>develop that TRUST in You, Your Products and/or Services<br>that You recommend.<br><br>Reason #2. It's a great way to get "Feedback".<br><br>Blogs are a great way to get Feedback from your<br>subscribers/customers simply because they have the ability<br>to leave comments on each "Post" you make which will then<br>help you find what it is they're looking for making YOU<br>look like a "Hero" in there eye's and putting $Money$ in<br>your pocket.<br><br>Reason #3. Can be managed by ONE individual.<br><br>Blogs require NO "HTML" experience, making it easy for<br>ANYONE to get started.<br><br>Most "Blog" communities online use what is called a<br>"WYSIWYG" HTML editor.<br><br>Did I lose you there with the "WYSIWYG" abbreviation. That<br>simply stands for... "What You See Is What You Get".<br><br>It's one of the easiest HTML editors to use, making it easy<br>for You to get started right away.<br><br>Reason #4. Your able to list your "Main" website details.<br><br>When you sign up for your Blogger account you're given an<br>area to set-up your "Personal Profile" where your able to<br>list your Main website and URL, plus, any other personal<br>information you wish to share that will be displayed on<br>your Blog.<br><br>Reason #5. A great way to publish "Information".<br><br>This is probably ONE of the Biggest benefits to Blogs<br>because you have the ability to post informative<br>information in the form of "Articles and/or Reviews" for<br>your subscribers and/or readership which will make you look<br>like an Expert on the subject and giving you INSTANT<br>credibility in the eye's of your reader.<br><br>Reason #6. You get your own URL.<br><br>That's right, you get your own URL you can use in all your<br>promotions and/or on your personal website if you have one.<br><br>This feature is great, especially for people just starting<br>out and don't have there own website up and running yet.<br><br>-----------------------------------------<br>Here's my Blog for you to take a look at.<br><br>It's called... The Internet Wonders Blog.<br>http://theiwe.blogspot.com<br>-----------------------------------------<br><br>Reason #7. Search Engines love them.<br><br>Search Engines love Blogs because they are so "Content<br>Rich" and are always being updated on a Daily to Weekly<br>basis.<br><br>When you compare a regular static website, which might be<br>updated on a monthly basis, to a Blog, which is updated on<br>a Daily to Weekly basis with NEW content, you'll gain favor<br>with the search engines with your Blog.<br><br>The S.E. "Spiders" will then gladly stop by to munch down<br>on whatever NEW content you posted and Index your website<br>more often since that is what Search Engines love and are<br>constantly looking for.<br><br>Reason #8. The ability to use RSS with Blogs.<br><br>A powerful feature about Blogs is the use of RSS(Really<br>Simple Syndication) that allows you to Instantly send your<br>Blog highlights to your readership upon publication which<br>will keep your reader up to speed on your business and your<br>Products and/or Services.<br><br>Not only that, RSS also gives your Blog more exposure to a<br>wider audience of subscribers building a bigger readership<br>in less time.<br><br>By simply adding an human element to your business through<br>the use of a "Blog", IS a great way to build rapport and<br>gain the trust of your subscribers and/or readership, which<br>in turn, will turn them into buying "Customers".<br><br>Well, there you have it, "BLOGS! What They Are... And WHY<br>They're Becoming A POWER TOOL For Internet Marketers".<br><br>I hope this article clearly answered the questions you once<br>had about "Blogs" and the benefits of starting one of your<br>own.
