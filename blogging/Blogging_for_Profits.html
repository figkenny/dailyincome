<p>Bloging (the act of writing to a blog) has become one of the fastest growing trends this year and many internet gurus believe that this is the new biggest trend.  Well, you might ask yourself what is the big deal I don't even know what a blog is?
<p>To put it simply a blog is a big deal because it can mean a lot of money for you.  First, lets define what a blog is then I will get to the good stuff the money and riches!  Blog is short for web log, it is just the two words pushed together.  You can kind of think of it like a Captains log on a ship, or a diary.  It is a quick and easy way to add content to the web with out having to use html.  It is instant, quick and really easy.  
<p>Now you might ask yourself why would I want to keep my diary online?  It basically is a great way to make money.  Let me explain that in a little more detail.  For most search engines there are two major factors in how well you rank, first is the content of your site and second are the links to your site.  Meaning the more key word focused content and the more links you have the higher you will rank in the search engine.  We all know it does not pay to be listed number 1 million out of 5 million for a keyword.  So everyone is competing for the top 10 spots.  Well, the quickest and easiest way to rank above the others is to add tons of key word focused helpful content to your site.  The more value you add to the internet the more value you will get out of it.  So you can help yourself by helping others and providing knowledge for free in the form of content.  A blog creates a very easy way to publish this content because it will publish your content tot he web as soon as you are done typing and best of all there are no html skills required.  In fact you can blog for free which I will talk about in article 2.  Secondly a blog is a great way to use some basic linking strategies that will help get your site into the search engines.  So by setting up a blog you can quickly publish high quality key word focused content and you can include tons of great links to your site.
<p>So let me quickly recap for you why you want to blog.  A blog provides a quick, often free way to publish your content on the web and an easy way to link to your website for more traffic.  These are important for any webmaster that wants to make money because it all converts to more traffic to your website and more traffic means more people purchasing your product.
<p>So now that you know what a blog is and why blogging is such a great thing you probably want to know how to get started blogging right now!  That will be covered in Blogging For Profit The series #2.
