Make Money Blogging by Selling Advertising Space<br><br>Before the advent of Blogs, we have e-zines and selling advertising space on ezines was a popular way to earn extra money. If you run your own Blog, you can let others advertise in your Blogs with banner ads, solo ads, sponsor ads, classifieds and so on.<br><br>Now that we have Blogs, you can repeat the same business model that e-zine publishers do, that of selling advertising space.<br><br>One popular advertising company that helps Bloggers look for advertisers is Blogads (www.Blogads.com).<br><br>Besides placing advertisers ads on your Blog, you can also make money Blogging by placing Google Adsense into your Blog.<br><br>In my "Marketing Rampage with Blogs and RSS" Videos, I show you how you can customize your Blog template to include the Google Adsense into your Blog template so that you can make money blogging.<br><br>2. How to Make Money Blogging by providing technical services such as Blog hosting or setting up Blog<br><br>You can also earn money blogging by providing technical services such as helping people to set up their Blogs or providing your own Blog hosting service.<br><br>One example of this is www.typepad.com . This is a Blog hosting service provider that charges a monthly fee. Typepad lets you create your Blog and they will host your Blog for you, and provide you with a number of Blog features.<br><br>3. Make Money Blogging by setttin up joint venture marketing<br><br>Joint Venture marketing is a powerful marketing strategy employed by many top online marketers.<br><br>Basically how joint venture works is this:<br><br>You promote person B's products to your subscriber and customer list, and you get a cut from whatever sale that follows from this promotion.<br><br>You can apply the principle of joint venture marketing to Blogs as well. If you have a substantial readership to your Blog, you can also promote or endorse certain products to your Blog readers and this way, and split the profits from the sales generated.<br><br>This is another way to make money blogging.<br><br>4. How to Make Money Blogging from using the Membership model<br><br>Over time, if your blog has lots of postings and provide good quality content, you can consider turning it into a membership site and charge access for it, again giving you another avenu<br><br>5. Make Money Blogging by turning your Blog contents into products <br>Another way in which you can make money blogging is to repackage your Blog contents into an e-book or an audio product and sell it. For example, if you run your own Podcasting show or an 'online radio show', you can easily compile your podcast recordings into a CD compiliation and sell it.<br><br>6. How to make money blogging by swapping blogs<br><br>You've heard of ad swapping when it comes to e-zine publishing, where publishers publish each other's ads in their own e-zines. This way, you save on adveritising costs.<br><br>You can repeat the same model to Blogs, as swap ads on Blogs as well. So instead of paying up front, you get to save, which means more money for you to spend!<br><br>7. Make money blogging by turning blog contents into RSS feeds and sell it as premium feeds<br><br>Your blog contents can be turned into an RSS feed. If the content is good, you can look for web businesses that are looking for good content for related topics and sell their feed to them.<br><br>8. How to Make Money Blogging by well, asking!<br><br>Hey, who's stopping you from putting a PayPal donation jar or button on your Blog? After all, there are lots of generous people out there you know.<br><br>9. Make Money Blogging as an Affiliate Marketer<br><br>Another way you can make money blogging is by promoting other people's products on your Blog. This is also known as affiliate marketing.<br><br>In affiliate marketing, you get paid a commission when someone clicks on your affiliate link and makes a purchase. Depending on the subject of your Blog, you can recommend products that solve people's problems.<br><br>For example, I had a subscriber who asked me how she can blog about cats and make money from blogging about cats.<br><br>I shared with her that firstly, perhaps she might want to go niche instead of targeting the broad category of "cats", and using the example of a Persian cat, which is a niche by itself, she can start a blog on Persian cats, providing valuable information as well as recommended solutions and products to the upkeep and maintenance of Persian cats.<br><br><p> About the Author
