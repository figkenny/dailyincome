      <h1 align="left"><font size="4" color="#FF6600">Writing Good Blogs</font></h1>
      <p align="left">There's a lot of blogs out there on the Web, most of which 
      don't entice one to go back regularly to read updates. What is missing 
      from these on-line journals that would essentially make them 'good' blogs? 
      Well, the answers in life usually come down to simplicities. So let's look 
      at the problem like we were children. Children don't complicate life with 
      miscellaneous information, and when they speak they tell you straight to 
      the point exactly how they feel and think about a subject. &nbsp; First of all, 
      we should ask the questions,&quot; Why do blogs exist? And what are they here 
      for?&quot; Well, in an ideal world 'good' blogs would help people connect, 
      sharing knowledge and feelings about issues in life. As they are journals 
      written by individuals we would hope that they'd be readable and open to 
      comment by all other people, not just a select group of friends. The key 
      is speaking in a way that is understandable by the masses, get rid of 
      acronyms and local slang that only few will comprehend. Keep the sentences 
      grammatically simple and generally short and concise. &nbsp; Try to write in 
      your blog as often as possible because if people enjoy reading your 
      thoughts and ideas they'll want to communicate or at least be filled in 
      regularly on 'your world'. Ask questions, comment on other blogs of 
      similar content, start communities with others you've never met, based on 
      your interests. Keep focused; if your blog is about thoughts on war and 
      peace, keep your thoughts on the latest movie and how hungry you are for 
      somewhere else. The idea is to incite intelligent communication so that in 
      time our collective stockpile of knowledge and wisdom will gradually grow 
      like a tree in fertile soil. &nbsp; I think of most importance is the fact that 
      you want this journal to be 'good' reading. Of course we all have ideas 
      about what genres and styles we like, but writing from your heart and soul 
      is imperative for the connection with others that you're looking for. 
      Share yourself; don't hide behind walls of fear of ridicule and judgment. 
      In real life relationships trust, respect, intimacy, and unity are all 
      necessary for a bond to form. It's the same in the 'virtual' world; people 
      want to hear from real people-not just one-sided, highly opinionated 
      arguments from egos that don't want to hear the 'other side of the coin'. 
      &nbsp; Now, in my last article I really tore apart most writers out there, and 
      here I'm giving some pretty complex ideas on how to fix the problem of 
      'bad' writing. In my next article I'll attempt to go back to the simple 
      basics of how to write for beginners. I hope I haven't come across as too 
      judgmental, I just truly believe the 'blog world' could become a real 
      asset to humanity, and at the moment it's missing the mark. &nbsp; Ideas about 
      sentence structure, grammar, paragraphing, using a thesaurus (varying 
      terms used so as not to sound repetitive), whether or not your blog is 
      suitable for a personal or professional approach, are all important to 
      creating a simple and enjoyable read for the blogging visitor. If you are 
      a beginner, please check out my next article on the basics.</p>
