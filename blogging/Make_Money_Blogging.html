Google Adsense<br>Google Adsense delivers text and image ads to the authorized websites/blogs depending on the content of the website.

Advertisers are required to pay only when any visitor clicks on their ads. They bid against each other for the keywords in order to receive better placement and thus prices for each keyword differ from one another. It is better to choose keywords for your blog which pays high $ per click.<br> <br>2. Amazon<br>Amazon Associate program is another important way to make money blogging. The Amazon Associate program gives opportunity to website/blog publishers to promote any product from its inventory by adding a predefined code to their website/blog, which, when clicked by a visitor, takes them to the relevant product page. Once the visitor buys the product, the blog owner will be compensated with a commission.<br><br>3. Blogads<br>You can use Blogads as an effective tool to have a better control over the advertisers in your blogs. You can analyze and compare your profits with any one of your online agencies. Blogads can be simply specified as an advertising service used for the web logs or blogs.

Text Links <br>Text links has emerged out to be the best form of moneymaking source that you can use instead of cluttering or crowding the page with ads.
