              <td align="left"><span class="style2">If you're hoping for a "Blog it and they will come" field of<br>dreams, you can forget that. Recent statistics from blog<br>search engine Technorati show that a new blog hits the<br>Internet every 7.8 seconds! Sheesh, talk about having to<br>rise above the noise level to be heard, how in the world are<br>you going to get eyeballs glued to your blog when there is<br>so much competition out there?<br><br>Unlike e-zine subscriptions or autoresponder mailings, it's<br>not the quantity of visitors that counts, it's the quality<br>of the visitors as well as how often they return to continue<br>reading your blog.<br><br>Quality, in this case, refers to how often they click on<br>revenue-generating links in your blog and how often they buy<br>something that you're blogging about. Of course, if you're<br>operating an altruistic blog that has no revenue-generating<br>features, then you are only concerned about how often the<br>readers return to bask in the illumination of your<br>knowledge, expertise, biting sarcasm or humor.<br><br>Either way, those are the two measurements of a successful<br>blog. Now don't get me wrong, the number of readers is<br>important, of course, but it's better to have 1,000 faithful<br>readers who return regularly than it is to have 5,000<br>readers who come once and you never see them again after<br>that.<br><br>There is no free traffic!<br><br>I love when bloggers say "I won't pay for traffic. I can get<br>it for free". Nothing is "free" my friend. You will either<br>pay for traffic with money or you will pay for traffic with<br>your time. Neither way is "free".<br><br>So what you have to do is decide which of these situations<br>describe you best:<br><br>A) You have more money than time.<br><br>If you are so blessed, then you need to develop an<br>advertising plan to help you spend your money wisely. An<br>advertising plan requires you to research the different<br>advertising programs that are available, study the<br>demographics of the traffic that you'll be receiving, make a<br>budget, set up test purchases and analyze the final results.<br><br>Well, you don't HAVE to develop an advertising plan. You can<br>always just throw money at different potential solutions and<br>hope for the best. If you do that enough times then you will<br>automatically end up in the "B" category of "more time than<br>money" because all of your money will be gone and you still<br>won't have any traffic.<br><br>B) You have more time than money.<br><br>You've got a great blog going, the few people who show up<br>already absolutely love it, but you're in a financial<br>crunch. Is there any hope for you?<br><br>Yep, there's plenty of hope. What you'll need though is a<br>lot on ingenuity and the time to turn your smarts into<br>traffic. Believe it or not, you should still develop an<br>advertising plan because even though you're not spending<br>cash, you are spending time. Time IS money and if you waste<br>time then you're wasting opportunities to get traffic to<br>your site.<br><br>No matter which way you end up paying for your traffic, time<br>or money, you should first make an investment in buying some<br>"knowledge" from people who have already been there, done<br>that and got the T-shirt. That way you can spend less and<br>get more bang for your buck or your time.<br><p> About the Author
