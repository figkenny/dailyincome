              <td align="left"><span class="style2">By the end of 2004 blogs had established themselves as a key<br>part of online culture. "Blog readership shoots up 58% in<br>2004 6 million Americans get news and information fed to<br>them through RSS aggregators But 62% of online Americans do<br>not know what a blog is." - Pew Internet & American Life<br>Project<br><br>Tip #1 - How and Where Should I Start?<br>You should begin your blog with a free blog hosting service<br>such as Blogger (http://www.blogger.com), or other similar<br>free services such as JournalHome.com, LiveJournal.com or<br>Blog-City.com. The learning curve for using such free<br>services allow you to spend more on developing your content<br>rather than worrying about the advanced areas of scripting,<br>hosting, or programming.<br><br>Tip #2 - The Things You Should Decide to Write About<br>Although not a required prerequisite for you in order to<br>write a blog, it is highly recommended to try to find a<br>topic to write about based on your level of interest and<br>knowledge. The higher your level of interest, the easier it<br>is for you to get your quality content posted on your blog.<br>Always try to choose an area which you can enthusiastically<br>write about on a daily basis.Try to pay attention to a niche<br>which suites you well. A niche is basically a targeted<br>product, service, or topic.<br><br>Tip #3 - Always stay on topic.<br>Opinions are generally accepted but the content of the items<br>in the blog should all relate to a general theme. The<br>majority of your readers will be interested in the content<br>that relates to a specific defined theme or loosely defined<br>area of interest. Define a topic and try not to run too far<br>away from it. This will ensure that you create a loyal<br>following of interested readers.<br><br>Tip #4 - Information is king, be informative.<br>If you are attempting to create the impression that you are<br>knowledgeable about a specific industry or sector, be sure<br>that you stay current on news. Checking your facts before<br>you're giving out an opinion or a product review is always a<br>good idea, your reputation is at stake. If by any chance<br>you're utilizing other people's articles for you blog<br>content, ensure that you follow the terms of usage defined<br>by the author.<br><br>Tip #5 - Old news is not news, but old information can be<br>recycled and made new. While blogging everyday can be<br>strenuous and time consuming, it is important that the<br>information presented is current and accurate. Information,<br>articles or any other archived resources can be recycled /<br>modified to add more substance to your content. As long as<br>they're relevant and informative, there's no reason why it's<br>not a good approach.<br><br>Tip #6 - Be disciplined and stick to a fixed posting<br>schedule. Realizing that blogging requires time and effort,<br>don't create unrealistic expectations and be unable to<br>deliver. If you have worked hard to develop an audience and<br>a community you don't want to lose them due to lack of<br>communication. If time is not on your side, take advantage<br>of tonnes of automatically updating contents which are<br>available for your blog. Looking at the constantly updating<br>nature of RSS feeds, other RSS feeds from similar topic can<br>be inserted within your blogging post.<br><br>Tip #7 - Posting Frequency<br>If your blog content is updated frequently, search engines<br>will tend to spider the pages at regular intervals. Updating<br>your blog daily not only keeps your blog more interesting to<br>readers, but it also gives your blog fresh content on a day<br>to day making it more appealing to search engines. To keep<br>your blog traffic and retain your visitors interest it is a<br>must to update your blog daily with multiple entries. You<br>should try to update your blog everyday with at least 2 - 3<br>or more daily entries, depending on your daily schedule.<br><br>Tip #8 - Quantity matters.<br>In order to attract the attention of search engines, you<br>will need to produce a relevant amount of content and<br>information. A headline or simple sentence is not going to<br>generate the interest of readers or help with search engine<br>ranking. Be sure to archive old blog posts to develop a<br>large portal of similarly-themed content.<br><br>Tip #9 - Clarity & simplicity / Short & Concise<br>Keep your posts and blog entries clear and easy to<br>understand. Simplicity always produce better results at the<br>end of the day.<br><br>Aside from the lengthy article a week for syndication and<br>publication your blog entries should be short & concise (if<br>you can help it). Should you insist on partaking on the<br>lengthy road, try to maintain a clean paragraphing style,<br>proper spacing, use different size, color and bold for your<br>titles as well as the subtitles. Use bullet points, go<br>straight to the point and never run out of topic. Insert<br>images to spice up things if you're an avid fan of long<br>posts.<br><br>Tip #10 - Utilize the <blockquote> and <code> tags<br>Being one of the few most underutilized blogging formatting<br>tags, these 2 items can help you on emphasizing certain<br>points, in the most efficient and striking way. Formatting<br>is simple and straightforward. Just <blockquote>Hi<br>World!</blockquote> and your message will apear<br>distinctively different from the rest of your text, thus<br>gets more attention which it deserves. Take note that the<br>formatting for these 2 tags differ from blog to blog<br>depending on how the owner defines the tag in the CSS<br>(Cascading Style Sheets).<br><br>Click the below link if you want to read more about CSS.<br>==>http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp<br><br>Tip #11 - Keyword-rich.<br>If the goal of your blog is to increase your visibility,<br>include related keywords in the title of the blog. Use the<br>title as a headline to attract interest. Each item post<br>should have a title that will attract attention but still be<br>relevant to the post. The title should be no longer than<br>10-12 words. Experiment with the titles if you must,<br>possibly try to avoid general and ordinary titles. Try to<br>include extraordinary and innovative titles to grab the<br>readers' attention.<br><br>Tip #12 - Spell checking and proof-reading.<br>It only takes a few extra moments and can save you from<br>having to make embarrassing explanations. The hazards of<br>Internet is that if you're too late to correct your mistake,<br>most likely it's already been crawled by the search engines<br>and read by many. It is extremely essential to think / proof<br>read carefully twice or even thrice, about what you post<br>before doing so. Take note of your language and grammar.<br><br>Tip #13 - RSS Feeds<br>RSS to a blog is like fuel to cars. Mostly every single free<br>blogs or bloggin software out there will have an automatic<br>RSS feed generating feature. Although it's most unlikely<br>that you'll find one without a RSS feature, simply leave it<br>and find a new one, if you happen to come across one without<br>it.<br><br>Tip #14 - The essence of the Internet - Traffic. It's no<br>secret. You must have traffic to realize the definition of a<br>blog.. There are numerous ways to build traffic. Paid and<br>free advertising, viral marketing, search engine marketing,<br>RSS/XML feeds, word-of-mouth, submitting to numerous blog<br>and RSS directories, etc. RSSBlogsubmit (<br>http://www.rssblogsubmit.com) provides a submission service<br>for your Blog & RSS feeds. You should always use your blog<br>URL address in the signature of your email, forum<br>discussions, message boards, or any other communication<br>media. Never forget to share your blog to your friends,<br>colleagues, and any other invidious that you know of.<br><br>Tip #15 - Track Your Blog<br>Tracking your blog does not have to be overly sophisticated<br>usually a simple free page counter like StatCounter.com,<br>ActiveMeter.com, Extremetracking.com or Sitemeter.com will<br>do the trick. Install (copy/paste) the code into the html of<br>your blog template and start tracking your visitors. Its<br>better to use a service which gives you advanced traffic<br>analysis, such as keyword tracking information, referral<br>information, and search engine information. Visitors,<br>returning visitors, and unique visitors should be standard<br>for any page counter service you choose.<br><br>Tip #16 - Make use of your Blog's statistical and tracking<br>information. Believe it or not, your visitors' information<br>from your tracking scripts will provide you priceless<br>information on how you can attract more readers. Keep note<br>on the keyword terms used from search engines which bring<br>you traffic. You can identify relevant closely related<br>topics which you can venture into and add more variety into<br>your blog, yet staying very much in topic. Simply put, more<br>topic coverage and more variety = more traffic. You may<br>analyze your tracking information further on how you can<br>strategize your blog's content. You can also apply some<br>keyword optimization strategies here.<br><br>Tip #17 - The essence of your Blog is your Audience, listen<br>to them. Always interact with your readers who post comments<br>on your blog. Reply with a brief thank you note or just<br>simply attend to their questions if they have any. It's a<br>proven fact when there's a direct human interaction and<br>knowing the fact that there's a "real human" at the other<br>end of the blog makes most of them coming back. If your<br>audience provide suggestions, comments or feedbacks, take<br>them constructively and inform them if you have any desires<br>of implementing such ideas on your next update. And of<br>course, don't forget to thank them for their ideas. If it's<br>a great idea, why not throw in a free gift? Mention their<br>website in your blog?<br><br>Tip #18 - Create and increase the "Why Must I Return" Value<br>to Your Blog<br>Everyone knows the fact that Blogs get a huge level of<br>returning visitors because of its constantly updated<br>content. Why don't you add more interesting items to that<br>return value by having fixed periodical posts / offers, e.g.<br>Monday Top 10 Tips, Picture of the Week, Free Bonus of the<br>Month, Free Daily Wallpapers, etc. to give them the absolute<br>excuse to return to your blog. As long as you can<br>efficiently and appropriately increase that Return Value<br>constantly, it is mostly guaranteed that you'll be getting<br>tonnes of repeated visitors, period.<br><br>An advance notice, prelaunch announcement or anything<br>similar to that also can act as a short term return value<br>strategy. Encourage readers to comment on your such notices<br>/ posts. Experiment and play around with this idea.<br><br>Tip #19 - Multiple blogs<br>It never hurts to use multiple blogging accounts to attract<br>more people. You can even have multiple blogs within<br>Blogger.com itself, but you may also want to try different<br>free blogging services such as JournalHome.com,<br>LiveJournal.com, Blog-City.com, etc. Should you have the<br>urge to have multiple similar duplicates of your blog just<br>to gain more traffic, it is wise to avoid it as search<br>engines / feed directories might translate that as excessive<br>redundant information which simply brings you trouble, and<br>you're tend to get penalized, banned or even accused of<br>spamming.<br><br>Tip #20 - Digital Art, Creative Graphics Another proven fact<br>- Monotonous and continous display of text will make your<br>readers run away! Try to include non- advertising graphics,<br>pictures, photos, and art in your blog entries, but try to<br>keep them at a limit. Too many graphics also mean slower<br>loading time and messy text and graphical combination. You<br>don't want your blog to look messy. Most of the time,<br>graphics can bring your blog to life. Pictures can make<br>boring texts interesting no matter how long it is. Graphical<br>elements are by far the fastest message delivering element<br>available on the net today. It may deliver various messages<br>by a split second of a look.<br><br>Tip #21 - Maintain a Personal Blog<br>A blog is most successful when it is kept personal. Try to<br>include personal experiences which relates to the topic of<br>your blog entry. Stay away from the business style of<br>writing. Write with a more personal style and use first-<br>person narratives. Share product reviews and personal<br>endeavors, instead of trying to make it sounds like you're<br>selling.<br><br>Tip #22 - Credibility & Popularity<br>As thing progresses, things need to change in order to cope<br>with the flow and nature of development. If your number of<br>readers are reasonably huge, and still using a free blogging<br>service to get your messages out, you may want to consider<br>getting your own domain name and hosting plan to have a more<br>personalized Blog.<br><br>Domain names and hosting plans are pretty much<br>straightforward. Research is all what it takes to get the<br>best of all the available options. For the most highly<br>recommended comprehensive listing of Free Blogging software<br>out there, drop by at http://www.opensourcecms.com/. This is<br>by far the best place to drop by if you want to get your<br>research done about which blogging software to choose.<br>Reviews, ratings, public votes, demos, etc are provided. And<br>the best thing is, all of them are Open Source, which means<br>they are totally free. Try going through the server<br>requirements for each software before purchasing your<br>web hosting.<br><br>Tip 23# - Customize the look of your Blog<br>If you happen to be using one of the Free blogging services<br>out there, you might notice that most of us are using the<br>same template again and again for our blogs. It is well<br>understood that not everybody has the technical knowledge to<br>change the layout as how they want it to be, but if you have<br>the knowledge, by all means try to customize it and make it<br>look DIFFERENT. You can grab that extra attention, if you're<br>different in certain ways. Create that image for yourself.<br><br>Tip #24 - Blog and Make Money<br><br>Once your blog has gained some real momentum and your blog<br>traffic is increasing then it is time to start thinking<br>if you want to turn your traffic into profit. Some of the<br>recommended income generating sources are as follow :-<br><br>Google Adsense, Amazon Associate program (www.amazon.com),<br>Blogads.com, Crispads.com, Tagword.com, Affiliate Programs<br>and any advertising related text links can be your place to<br>start off.<br><br>Final #Tip - Conclusion.<br>Following these blogging tips should make your blogging<br>experience much more rewarding. Blogging is generally done<br>out of interest and enthusiasm and sometimes for income<br>generating purposes. The flexibility of blogging will never<br>cease to expand. Through time, dedication, and persistence<br>you will be rewarded with all the royalties of blogging.<br><p> About the Author
